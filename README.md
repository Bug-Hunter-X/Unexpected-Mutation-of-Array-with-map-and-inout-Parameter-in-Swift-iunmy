This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Swift related to the unexpected mutation of arrays when using the `map` function with an `inout` parameter. The `bug.swift` file contains code that reproduces the issue, while `bugSolution.swift` provides a solution to avoid the unintended side effect.  The bug arises because using `inout` with `map` reassigns the entire array, even though `map` is designed to create a new array.  The solution emphasizes avoiding `inout` with `map` to prevent unexpected mutations and ensure predictable behavior. This is important for writing robust and maintainable Swift code.
